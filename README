===============================================================================

Ariadne is a web application server and a content management system. It is a 
lot like Zope, but not quite the same.

Simply put, Ariadne stores and retrieves PHP objects in a database (MySQL or 
PostgreSQL.) Ariadne does this by simulating a file system in the database.
This simulated filesystem understands operations like 'ls','find','link', 
and 'get'. It adds database indexes (properties) to this, which can be used
with the find command. Each object can be retrieved by another object or 
directly through a url. Objects can create, delete and modify other objects 
through these and other operations.

Objects can have multiple views, or functions. These are different forms and
layouts to represent and change the same underlying object. These views are 
called 'templates'. A template can be formed from a combination of text 
elements, like HTML or XML and PHP code. A template is called from within an 
object so you can use functions related to that object's class in templates.
The templates created via the web interface use a 'safe' subset of PHP, called 
PINP. This prevents access to PHP functions that access the file system or
database directly.

The objects and templates shipped provide a rich management system for a
website. But the real power of Ariadne lies not in the easy online management
of a website, but in it's fast and powerfull object manipulation and
retrieval. It's very easy to build a complex dynamic website with multiple
interactive object types and complex views. As an example a pretty complex
calendar application is shipped with Ariadne. But you could also build a
threaded message board, a complex multi-site news system or even a clickable
map of a country, with different selectable categories of information mapped
on it. The last two have been done already :)

Also built in is a complete user and rights (or grants) management system.
You can create a new user, add it to different groups and change grants for
users and groups on objects. 

A lot more is possible, but you'll have to see for yourself.

Do read the installation instructions as Ariadne is very particular about
it's installation. They are in the file INSTALL.
