Known issues

- WYSIWYG Htmleditor 

  - breaks on 'broken' html.

  The Internet Explorer html editor cannot edit framesets or html files with
  multiple body statemens. There should be a check on this and a 'backup' edit
  possibility.

  - switch between WYSIWYG / HTML view is 'lossy'

  It seems to be impossible to let the microsoft dhtml editing component
  keep the source code intact. Specifically, switching from HTML source view
  to WYSIWYG view will lose/mangle javascript code. We've been unable to get
  the dhtml editor to work as advertised (by Microsoft that is).


- Missing features.

  In this beta there are still a number of unimplemented screens. This will
  be fixed in the next release. All the important screens are working though 
  (we hope).
