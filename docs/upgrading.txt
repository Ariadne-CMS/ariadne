Upgrading to 2.0                                                   Muze Ariadne
===============================================================================

Ariadne 2.0 introduces a lot of low level changes in the database store. The 
export file format is changed a bit too, but is backwards compatible with 
2.0b10 and 2.0b11. If you are running an older version of Ariadne, please see
the instructions at the section 'Upgrading from Ariadne 2.0b9 or earlier'.

The following instructions should be used whenever you install a new version 
of Ariadne, unless stated otherwise.

0.	Backup your Ariadne code and database. But you do that regulary
	anyway, right? :)

1.	Before you upgrade the Ariadne code, export your current site. 
	You can run export as root, or as the web user (e.g. www-data),
	from the ariadne/bin/ directory, e.g.:

	./export --with-grants / oldsite.ax

2.	Install Ariadne 2.0 in a new directory. Follow the normal installation 
	procedure.

3.	Now import the export file, either via the web interface or through the 
	command line import tool, e.g:

	./import --with-grants oldsite.ax /

	When using the command line import tool, make sure you 'su' to the same
	user id that is used to run the webserver, e.g. 'www-data' or 'nobody' 
	depending on your configuration.

That's it. Your old website should now work in the new Ariadne. Check if 
everything is ok and then remove the old Ariadne version. Don't forget the 
databases.

1.	Before you upgrade the Ariadne code, export your current site. 
	You can run export as root, or as the web user (e.g. www-data),
	from the ariadne/bin/ directory, e.g.:

	./export / oldsite.ax
	

2.	Install Ariadne 2.0b10 as if it was a fresh Ariadne installation.
	Please see the file INSTALL for more information.
	Make sure that you do not use the same database as for the previous
	version of Ariadne. You can also simply drop the old databases and
	remove the old code...

3.	In ariadne.2.0b10/bin/ run:

	./axconvert [ax_file] > [new_ax_file]

	e.g.

	./axconvert oldsite.ax > newsite.ax

	This converts your old data to the new file format.

4.	Now make sure you are logged in as the web user (e.g. www-data) or
	root and run:

	import [new_ax_file] [path]

	e.g.

	import newsite.ax /

	If you ran it as root, make sure the files (ariadne/files/) are chowned 
	to the web user.
