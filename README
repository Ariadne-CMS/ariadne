===============================================================================

Ariadne is a web application framework and a content management system. It has
been in continuous use and development since 1998. 

Ariadne is not a framework in the sense that it allows you to pick and choose
parts of the system to use in your own application. It is a framework in the
sense that it provides a stable system that implements all the mundane stuff
you need to build a website or web application, large or small.

Things you don't have to worry about anymore include:

* defining SQL tables and queries
* retrieving, changing and storing content
* security of your site
* user management
* caching
* templating
* site management
* natural language support (or i18n and l10n)


In addition Ariadne is also a CMS. Out of the box you can create sites with
multiple sections, newspapers, calendars, photo galleries, etc. You do need
to define your own layout, but the templating system makes that easy.

Ariadne is a very stable and scalable platform. It has been used to host
large numbers of different websites for different customers, as wel as web
applications with many millions of objects. It is also very secure, no valid
security problems have been reported since 2003.

Ariadne is not like the new breed of PHP CMS systems, in that it advocates or
forces use of a single Design Pattern. It doesn't force any specific way
of designing your web site. Anything you want can be build in Ariadne. Just
browse to http://www.ariadne-cms.org/ and start learning how.
