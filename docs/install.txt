Installing Ariadne.                                            Muze Ariadne 2.1
===============================================================================

  IMPORTANT: Ariadne needs PHP4.0.6 or higher *

  * If you don't need the FTP daemon, PHP 4.0.3pl1 is the minimum
           

Windows
=======

  We've tested Ariadne with Windows NT, Windows 2000 Server and Windows 2000
  Professional. Full Installation instructions for windows can be found in 
  the file 'install.win.rtf'.
  
Unix/Linux
==========

Requirements:
  Apache
  PHP4 (not running in safe mode and not installed as CGI but as an Apache module)
  MySQL

Recommended:
  ImageMagick

1) Untar the Ariadne distribution. (since you're reading this, I guess
   that's already taken care off...)
2) Move the www, lib and files directories to their proper place. Preferably you
   don't want the lib and files directories under the document root. 
   e.g.:

     cd /usr/local/lib/
     tar xvzf ~/ariadne.2.1.tgz
     cd /var/www
     ln -s /usr/local/lib/ariadne/www/ ariadne

3) Make sure the files directory and the sessions directory are writable by the 
   webserver user.
   Ariadne needs to write cache images and templates and other files to
   disk. So check to see which user your webserver is running as (look in
   httpd.conf, we'll presume www-data here) and (as root) do something like:

     cd /usr/local/lib/ariadne/files/
     chown -R www-data:www-data * 
     cd /usr/local/lib/ariadne/sessions/
     chown -R www-data:www-data * 

3) Create a database for Ariadne to use in MySQL.
   With MySQL do something like:

     mysqladmin create ariadne

4) Copy the file ariadne.phtml-unix in lib/configs to ariadne.phtml. Edit this
   file and fill in your system specific details. You need to at least enter 
   your host name, database name, database account and check all the paths.

5) Copy the file www/ariadne.inc-unix to www/ariadne.inc and edit it to reflect 
   the includepath to the Ariadne lib directory.

6) Run the file www/install/install.php. 
   You can do this from the browser or, if you have the cgi version of php 
   installed, from the command line.

7) Point your webbrowser to your installed Ariadne url. You'll be asked for a 
   username and password. Use username 'admin' and password 'muze'.
   If everything is installed properly you should now see an explorer like
   interface with 'Administrator' in the top left corner.
   If you have trouble logging in, try running www/install/setadmin.php
   from a webbrowser. It allows you to set your admin password. Then try again.

8) If everything works ok click on 'Administrator', then on 'edit' in the
   frame on the right. Now change the administrator password. 

9) Move the directory www/install and all it's contents somewhere safe,
   meaning _not_ in your webserver's documentroot.
   Really.

10) Schedule the cleanup script (bin/cleanup) to run daily. It removes
    expired session data.

11) To make full use of image manipulation you need to have ImageMagick
    installed. Make sure the path to ImageMagick is correctly set in the Ariadne
    config. ImageMagick can be obtained from http://www.imagemagick.org/www/archives.html

manuals, etc. can be found at http://ariadne.muze.nl/
