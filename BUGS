Known issues

- NLS:
  If you edit an object with multiple languages and remove all data from one
  language and then switch to another language and back, all the old data is
  back again... 
  Reason: The problem is the getdata function which automatically
  retrieves data from the object if there's no data of the same name in the
  form variables...
  Solution: keep the hidden form variables even if they're empty?

- Import/export grants
  When you export a tree of data, you will also get the grants set in these
  objects. When this tree is imported in another system, these grants should
  either be removed or also set in the corresponding user objects.. if these
  exist.
  Solution: make this an option when creating an exportfile, or when
  importing an exportfile.

- WYSIWYG Htmleditor breaks on 'broken' html
  The Internet Explorer html editor cannot edit framesets or html files with
  multiple body statemens. There should be a check on this and a 'backup' edit
  possibility.
