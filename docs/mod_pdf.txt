The new pdf module is a wrapper around fpdf, and works exactly like it. 
You cannot currently override the default behaviour of the pdf module, like
defining your own WriteHTML(). But you can do all the 'normal' stuff that
fpdf allows. The WriteHTML() method in the wrapper already knows basic html
stuff like headings, paragraphs, links, underline, bold and italic. It doesn't
yet support tables or images.

Make sure your template has the .pdf extension, or otherwise MSIE will not show
your pdf correctly. (If someone figures out the magic http headers to make MSIE
behave correctly, please send them to me).

ppage::view.pdf
<pinp>

  load('mod_pdf.php');

  $pdf=PDF::init();

  $pdf->Open();
  $pdf->AddPage();
  $pdf->SetFont('Arial','',10);
  $pdf->WriteHTML(GetPage());
  $pdf->Output();

</pinp>
