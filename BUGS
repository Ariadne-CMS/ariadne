Known issues

- WYSIWYG Htmleditor 

  - breaks on 'broken' html.

  The Internet Explorer html editor cannot edit framesets or html files with
  multiple body statemens. The solution is to switch to the 'text' editor
  temporarily and edit the offending page through that interface.

  - switch between WYSIWYG / HTML view is 'lossy'

  It seems to be impossible to let the microsoft dhtml editing component
  keep the source code intact. Specifically, switching from HTML source view
  to WYSIWYG view will lose/mangle javascript code. We've been unable to get
  the dhtml editor to work as advertised (by Microsoft that is).
