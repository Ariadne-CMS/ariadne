Ariadne 2.0b10

Changes in ariadne since version 2.0b9

New Features
- Object templates are automatically inherited to subclasses, just like
  Class templates.
- Easier configuration, the files are more readable and contain better
  default values.
- A new photobook. The photobook automatically generates thumbnails of
  images and allows easy navigation.
- The HTML Editor has a new image dialog, you can now select images from
  the ariadne tree to insert into a page.
- Private Cache. Page Caching can only be used

Important Bugfixes
- Cache, now uses output buffering and actually works.
- HTMLEditor now displays the correct paragraph styles even in non-english 
  browsers, thanks to Matt Finn, NETDesign Inc.

Changes in ariadne since version 2.0b8

- Added pinp functions:
	_get_addresses and _call_address

- lib/modules/mod_ax.phtml
	- system() commands are now checked by exitcode
	instead of the result of the command (output).

	- added $this->RmDir() which deletes directories
        even when these contains files.
	This eliminates the need for the system "rm -rf " call.

	- fixed problem with importing files:
	importfiles tried to untar even if there wasn't a tgz file available.


Changes in ariadne since version 2.0b7

  This is mainly a bugfix release. 

The following features were added:
- Client-side cache headers are now sent (if caching is enabled). These 
  default to an expiration time of one hour, unless the server side cache
  expires earlier.
- Shift-reload now refreshes a cache image on the server.
- A few PINP functions were added:
  startsession(), putsessionvar($varname, $varvalue), 
  getsessionvar($varname), killsession() and sessionid()
- objects now save the languages they are available in as:
  $this->data->nls->list[$nls]=$language;
  This can be accessed in object templates as:
  <pinp> while (list($nls, $language)=each($data->nls->list)) { ... } </pinp>

The following bugs were fixed:
- Changing your password now automatically logs you in again under your new
  password.
- The recursive delete now asks for confirmation and actually seems to work.
- import and export now give more meaningfull error messages.
- Caching of objects in multiple languages works.
- index.html objects in a directory can now be cached.
- particle->parse_summary() is fixed.
- Textarea's now also wrap in netscape
- The WYSIWYG editor now works with particle.
- pobject->setnls has been fixed.
- Session ID's sometimes contained illegal characters, fixed.

Changes in ariadne since version 2.0b6

  Quite a lot has changed since the previous version. We've added session
support, a new login system using sessions, a preview of the new user
interface  which makes use of a new wizard widget and dropdown
menu's (select 'new' as interface in your user's edit screen, there's
currently no way to reset this but via this template, so it's best to
remember the url :). 
  The new interface has also led to a more defined naming
scheme for class templates, if you look at the pobject templates you'll see
the difference. For now the old interface and the old templates are still
there, they will be removed though. 
  Also the new interface currently only supports Internet Explorer 4 or 
better or Netscape 4 or better. This is only required for users to use the 
new management interface though.

  Then there's the new WYSIWYG html editor (for Internet Explorer 4
and up users only, sorry :), better support for object templates (new and
improved PINP functions). We've also added a new addressbook application,
which is looking a bit bland right now, but is fully functional.

  If you look at the install script you'll see that it actually 'imports' a
data file (ariadne.2.0b7.ax) which contains all the data, including
templates and files, in the ariadne tree. In the bin/ directory you'll find 
an import and export script with which you can create and import these files
yourself. You will need to have php installed as an alternative shell
though. In the next release this functionality will also be available
through a webbrowser.
  The new install script allowed us to create a 'richer' startup database.
We will be using this to create an online help system, among other things.

  We've started using CVS for Ariadne, so if you want a more complete list
of changes, read the file CVS_ARIADNE on how to get public read access.

Pre CVS changes:

* Added import/export module, you can now import and export entire trees of
  data.
  Affected files:
  lib/templates/pobject/
    import.phtml
    export.phtml
    exportobject.phtml
  lib/includes/
    import.phtml
    export.phtml
  www/
    export.phtml   

lib/stores/mysql.phtml
  fixed a bug in the mod_lock init, password was reset to "" before the call
  to init.
  fixed a bug in the save method, saving an object under root did set root
  as parent of the object, parent is now "..". 

lib/templates/particle/save.phtml
lib/templates/particle/form.phtml
lib/templates/pscenario/select.html
  fixed a bug, if a scenario name was not the same as its filename articles
  using it wouldn't save their start and endtimes.
lib/templates/pscenario/form.phtml
  fixed a bug, buttons were always in english, changed to correct nls calls.
lib/templates/pcalitem/edit.phtml
  fixed a bug, forgot to use $ARnls to check for pressed buttons.

Changes in ariadne since version 2.0b5

* Migrated to PHP4. PHP3 is no longer supported, this is because PHP3 was
  really not suited to the complex jobs ariadne put it to. PHP4 is a lot
  easier on memory and performance. Also a few bugs were impossible to fix in
  PHP3.
  - AR_IMPORT is now replaced by include_once
  - all php files now have the extension .php

lib/templates/pshortcut/default.phtml
lib/templates/pshortcut/treeinit.phtml
lib/templates/pshortcut/treeload.phtml
  shortcut now supports relative paths. These paths are mapped to absoulte
  paths starting at the parent of the shortcut! Thus adding a shortcut in
  /system/users/admin/ to ../public/ will result in the computed path of
  /system/users/public/


* Added mod_lock , read lib/modules/mod_lock/README for more information
  affected files:
  configs/ariadne.phtml
  - configure and instantiate mod_lock as $AR->mod_lock
  modules/mod_lock.phtml
  - modlock class definition
  widgets/formlock/js.html
  - this file will be included by form templates. It will relock
    the object every $AR->mod_lock->lock_duration-60 seconds.
  includes/lock.phtml
  - locks calling object ($this->path), returns $arResult=false on failure,
    ($ARCurrent->locks[$this->path] will be stored with mod_lock result)
    will return $arResult=true on success.
  includes/unlock.phtml
  - unlock calling object
  include/viewlocks.phtml
  - Will generate a page with paths which locks calling object.
  include/delete.phtml
  - Locks whole tree
  include/save.phtml
  - Locks calling object
  templates/*/edit.phtml
  - will lock objects. If this can't be done, it will call
    include/viewlocks.phtml
  templates/*/form.phtml
  - includes widgets/formlock/js.html
  templates/*/UnLock.phtml
  - includes include/unlock.phtml
  template/*/Lock.phtml
  - includes include/lock.phtml


lib/objects/pobject.phtml
  $this->nlsdata is now a copy of $this->data->$nls, otherwise the nls
  changes in CheckConfig would not change $nlsdata in a template.
  
lib/templates/*/save.phtml
  bug fixed: Check on default language was incorrect ($this->nls instead of
  $ARconfig->nls->default)
  bug fixed: Now resets $AR->nls->list before trying to loop through it...

lib/widgets/nls/form.phtml
  bug fixed. Special characters in language names prevented that language
  from being selected in a form. This is now fixed. (Do not enter html
  entity codes for special characters in the nls configuration!)

lib/configs/ariadne.phtml
  added $ARConfig->nls=$AR->nls to make sure that this is always set.
  CheckConfig will still override this with local defaults.

www/install/install.php
  removed spurious ;'s in initialize(), some MySQL versions apparantly don't
  like that.

www/loader.php
  removed <?php_track_vars?> as it is no longer supported...

Changes in ariadne since version 2.0b4

lib/widgets/nls/form.phtml
  fixed a bug: now replaces all '"''s with &quot; in the hidden input field.
lib/widgets/htmledit/form.html
  changed the RawUrlEncode to change only " to &quot; in the hidden input
  field.
lib/widgets/htmledit/js.html
  removed the escape/unescape part of Set and GetHTML.

www/widgets/tree/root.phtml
  fixed a bug: now UpdateLinks also adds the correct flag image and font to
  each node.

files:
  added missing directory files/temp
  fixed a typo in pfile/form.phtml and updated the layout
  resized upload window to better fit the new pfile form.
  fixed a bug in pfile/delete.phtml: used $data->name instead of $data->filename

lib/templates/pobject/config.phtml
  fixed a bug: title now displays the name from $nlsdata instead $data.

Changes in ariadne since version 2.0b3

important

* Added support for multiple language sites. almost every object now has
  inbuilt support for this. This has precipitated some big changes in code.
  More information is in the file NLS.

general

  Changed IMPORT to AR_IMPORT. This solves the name conflict with php4.0b4+
  FIXME: convert to the new IMPORT function, when this is stable in php4

  Changed all scripts under www to extension .php3, as this is more common.

lib/objects/pnewspaper.phtml
  Changed the whole object (former object wasn't supposed to be released)
  added extra argument $max in get_articles (also for PINP)

lib/objects/particle.phtml
  Changed the whole object (former object wasn't supposed to be released)

lib/templates/pscenario/form.phtml
  Priority is now a property of pscenario and not of the displays

lib/objects/pobject.phtml
  Changed call(). It's arguments are now passed by value, instead of by
  reference. This solves the crash when using call with fixed strings.

lib/objects/puser.phtml
  Changed CheckPassword to add support for FreeBSD crypt. It now checks the
  format of the encrypted password. See also:

www/install/setadmin.php3
  Added because the normal crypted password for admin in install.php3 cannot 
  be used in the case of FreeBSD. After running install.php3, you need to run
  setadmin.php3 in this case.

lib/templates/pobject/EditTemplate.phtml
  Changed form to method=Post, as IE has a rather low limit on URL size.

lib/templates/pobject/RemoveTemplate.phtml
  Fixed a bug that caused all templates of the same name to be deleted when
  deleting one.

www/loader.php3
  Fixed a bug: arrays in forms with method=post wouldn't get passed to a
  template. Now even PHP4's multiple dimension arrays are passed correctly.
