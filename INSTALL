Welcome to Ariadne!

To start the installation, please follow these steps:

- create a database for Ariadne to be installed in

- copy the www directory to your webroot and give it a suitable name, eg
'ariadne'.

- copy the file 'ariadne.inc-unix' or 'ariadne.inc-win' in your ariadne 
www directory to 'ariadne.inc'. Choose the correct version depending on 
your server operating system.

- edit ariadne.inc, and point $ariadne to the path of the lib directory, eg.
/usr/local/ariadne/lib or /home/youruser/ariadne/lib

- give write grants for the user your webserver runs as, typically www-data 
in unix systems, to ariadne/lib/configs/ariadne.phtml

- give write grants for www-data to ariadne/files/ and its subdirectories.

- give write grants for www-data to the ariadne/lib/configs/svn/ directory 
if you want to enable support for the Subversion versioning system (SVN). 

- remove the .htaccess file from the ariadne/www/install/ folder temporarily. 
You must either restore it after installation or remove the entire install 
directory when you are done.

- point your webbrowser to http://yourhost/ariadne/install/ to start 
installation.
	

After a succesful installation:

- remove the www/install folder or restore the .htaccess file.

- schedule the cleanup script in the bin folder to remove unused files and 
session data. In unix systems you can use the crontab tool for this.

- remove write access to lib/configs/ariadne.phtml for www-data.

Enjoy Ariadne!
