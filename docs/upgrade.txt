Upgrade                                                            Muze Ariadne 
===============================================================================

If you want to upgrade Ariadne 2.0 to Ariadne 2.1 take care of the following:

Ariadne 2.1 internally exclusively uses the UTF-8 characterset. This means
that if you want to use your old ariadne data with this version, you
need to make sure that your old data will also be imported as UTF-8.

If your old data is not already in the UTF-8 charset, you can use the
import mechanism to convert this. The parameters are:

	--convertToUTF8-[nls]=[charset]

This option tells import to convert all data for the
language [nls] from the charset [charset] (CP1252 is default) to
UTF-8.

Note 1: The conversion routine uses the iconv character conversion routines,
which are part of the normal C library. Depending on which C library you
use, you may or may not be able to convert from the source character set to
UTF-8.

Note 2: CP1252 is the name of the character set that windows uses instead
of ISO-LATIN-1 (ISO-8859-1) in most western countries. It is the normal 
latin-1 character set extended with a few extra characters.
