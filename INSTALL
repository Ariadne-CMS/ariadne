Installing Ariadne.											  Muze Ariadne 2.0b9
================================================================================

  IMPORTANT: This version of Ariadne needs PHP4!
           
  Because of the many problems with PHP3 and objects, and because 
  of the better memory management of PHP4, we've completely
  switched to PHP4. You should too :)

  What this means is that you no longer need to compile the PHP into apache,
  you can now also use php4 as a module (--with-apxs)
  Because of a few changes in php4 with regard to configuration settings,
  you will need to tune your php.ini. Specifically, Ariadne is allergic to 
  magic_quotes, so set all magic_quotes to 'Off'. Also, Ariadne needs the
  php.ini setting track_vars set to 'On'.

Windows

  Well, it looks like we finally found a way to get Ariadne to run under
  windows. It still won't run with Microsoft IIS, as we are unable to get 
  the PATH_INFO working, even after following Microsofts own rather barok 
  advice from TechNet, involving buying a certain book and installing a
  small program included on a CD in that book.. doh 
  But we've gotten some good results with Apache, which is a better webserver 
  anyway :) Unfortunately it's not entirely finished, as Ariadne needs quite
  a lot of software not normally available under Windows. We're working on
  creating a complete distribution for windows. Hold on a bit longer, it's
  almost there :)
  
Unix/Linux

Requirements:
  Apache
  PHP4 not running in safe mode
  MySQL

1) untar the Ariadne distribution. (since you're reading this, I guess
   that's already taken care off...)
2) move the www, lib and files directories to their proper place. Preferably you
   don't want the lib and files directories under the document root. 
   e.g.:

     cd /usr/local/lib/
     tar xvzf ~/ariadne.2.0b9.tgz
     cd /var/www
     ln -s /usr/local/lib/ariadne.2.0b9/www/ ariadne

3) Make sure the files directory and the sessions directory are writable by the 
   webserver user.
   Ariadne needs to write cache images and templates and other files to
   disk. So check to see which user your webserver is running as (look in
   httpd.conf) and (as root) do something like:

     cd /usr/local/lib/ariadne.2.0b9/files/
     chown -R www:www * 
     cd /usr/local/lib/ariadne.2.0b7/sessions/
     chown -R www:www * 

3) create a database for Ariadne to use in MySQL.
   With MySQL do something like:

     mysqladmin create ariadne
     mysqladmin create ariadne_sessions

4) copy the files ariadne.phtml-dist, store.phtml-dist and
   sessions.phtml-dist in lib/configs to ariadne.phtml, store.phtml and
   sessions.phtml respectively and edit them to match your system.
   You need to at least enter your host name and check all paths.

5) if you're using a shared mysql module with php, make sure you uncomment
   the line 'dl("mysql.so");' in lib/stores/mysqlstore.phtml 

6) copy the file www/ariadne.inc-dist to www/ariadne.inc and edit it to reflect 
   the includepath to the Ariadne lib directory.

7) run the file www/install/install.php. 
   You can do this from the browser or, if you have the cgi version of php 
   installed, from the command line.

8) point your webbrowser to your installed Ariadne url. You'll be asked for a 
   username and password. Use username 'admin' and password 'muze'.
   If everything is installed properly you should now see an explorer like
   interface with 'Administrator' in the top left corner.
   If you have trouble logging in, try running www/install/setadmin.php
   from a webbrowser. It allows you to set your admin password. Then try again.

9) If everything works ok click on 'Administrator', then on 'edit' in the
   newly appeared tabdisplay on the right. Now change the administrator
   password. You will immediately be asked for authorization again.

10) move the directory www/install and all it's contents somewhere safe,
    meaning _not_ in your webserver's documentroot.
    Really.
	****IMPORTANT**** We've added a guest user in the ariadne database in this
    release (2.0b9). It has login 'guest' and password 'guest'. You should
    change the password immediately after installation, or remove the user. 
    It is there only as an example.

11) Make sure you have the magic_quotes_gpc setting set to 'Off' and
    track_vars to 'On'

12) Schedule the cleanup script (bin/cleanup) to run daily. It removes
    expired session data.
