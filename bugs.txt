KNOWN ISSUES

- When renaming an object the grants set for users on that object are not
  updated. This means the grants on the user will break since they point to
  the old filename of the object. Workaround: Delete all grants pointing to
  the object before renaming the object.
- When uploading a file with an existing filename in Ariadne it will
  popup an overwrite confirmation dialog. Pressing "Ok" yes overwrite does
  not work. Workaround: Delete the old file and upload a new one.
