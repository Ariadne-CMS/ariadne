Welcome to a new version of Ariadne!

If you have an existing Ariadne installation and want to upgrade to the
latest version, either copy the new distribution over the previous one,
or create a new base directory for Ariadne. In the latter case, make
sure you copy all the configuration files and either copy the original 
ariadne/files/ directory to the new location, while keeping the user
grants intact (it should be writable for the webserver user).

Then make sure the ariadne/www/install/ directory is open by removing 
the .htaccess file there temporarily and open a browser at your ariadne
installation at ariadne/install/upgrade/upgrade.php

If there is a need to run additional upgrade scripts, this page will 
tell you what the next steps are.
