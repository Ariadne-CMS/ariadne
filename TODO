Things still to do before the final (non beta) release
(in semi random order)

+ Recursive file operations (move, copy, delete, etc.)
  -> Gijsbert te Riet

= Im-/Exporting parts of the ariadne database.
+ And the next step, full replication between ariadne systems.
  -> Gijsbert te Riet

= Check windows compatibility.
  -> Auke van Slooten / Bart Roelofsma

+ Find a suitable full text indexer.
  -> Wouter Commandeur

- A way to have a certain path as root of a website. Currently all links
  are displayed as full absolute paths from a certain ariadne root. For
  multiple websites who use different parts of a single ariadne store, this
  won't work.
  e.g. root.ariadne.com -> /
       ahost.ariadne.com -> /a/certain/object/
  check to see if Apache's rewrite rules allow this to work.

- Parents($path):
  call all parents upto and including $path.

- Scheduler
  Needs to be able to start an action or template at a given time. Best is
  probably to use the unix 'at' command. Don't know a windows equivalent.

- Write support for more database stores.

- Build a working substore
  A simple SQL link object would probably be the best start.

- Make it possible to somehow restrict which HTML tags are allowed in the
  (WYSIWYG) html editor.

- General code cleanup:
  Identify inconsistent names, reduce includes, rethink object inheritance
  tree, etc.

- Implement search in the management interface.

- Check all objects for further pinp functionality needed (pfile ->
  show/read file, pcalendar, etc.)

- Write more language files (lib/nls), specifically spanish, italian and
  german... anybody?

--------------------------------------------

- change the object templates system: 
  - object templates should also be inherited through the typetree, e.g.
    if there is a template 'x' defined in pobject, in a certain directory,
    it should also be available to 'pdir' etc.
    or if it was defined for 'pdir' it should be available to 'pcalendar'
    but not to 'ppage'.
  problem: algortihm to search for templates will become a bit more
           difficult.. as in, difficult to understand and follow.
