How to get SVN support going in Ariadne
Version 0.1, 21 Nov 2007

It's quite easy actually..

Step 1: the VersionControl pear module.
=========================
Use Muze's version of this module, because several additions have been made
to the module that are not yet in the pear module.

Under debian the pear code should
go under

/usr/share/php

so use  "svn co https://svn.muze.nl/svn/muze/pear/VersionControl
/usr/share/php/VersionControl"

to checkout the neccesary support code.


Step 2: Turning it on in the lib/configs/ariadne.phtml
==================================
Search in the lib/configs/ariadne.phtml for a line

$AR->SVN->enabled = true | false

and make sure it's true.


Step 3: log into Ariadne backend and enjoy.
============================
Login through http://yoursite.nl/ariadne

You should see svn commands on three levels:
	- meta elvel where you can do thing recursive all the way down.
	- object template level where you can handle all the templates on
that object
	- tempate level where you can work on the specific template


reminder
======
The svn command buttons use the SVN terminology. So import means "import
into svn"..
