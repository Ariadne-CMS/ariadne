People who want to upgrade their ariadne to ariadne 2.1 need to take care
of the following:

Ariadne 2.1 internally uses the UTF-8 characterset. This means
that if you want to use your old ariadne data with this version, you
need to make sure that your old data will also be imported as UTF-8.

If your old data is not already in the UTF-8 charset, you can use the
import mechanism to convert this. The parameters are:

	--convertToUTF8-[nls]=[charset]

This option tells import to convert all data for the
language [nls] from the charset [charset] (CP1252 is default) to
UTF-8.
