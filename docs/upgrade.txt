Upgrade                                                            Muze Ariadne 
===============================================================================
If you want to upgrade Ariadne 2.2.x to Ariadne 2.4(.x) then take care of the
following:

Ariadne 2.4 has moved all it's configuration data from $data to $data->config.
This means that all templates, grants, language settings, etc will not be
found by Ariadne 2.4 when using your old Ariadne database. To fix this,
we have made an upgrade script which will take care that your database 
(from Ariadne 2.2.x) will get upgraded to an Ariadne 2.4 compatible one.

This upgrade script talked about above, can be accessed via your browser
at the following address:

If you want to upgrade Ariadne 2.0 to Ariadne 2.1 take care of the following:

Ariadne 2.1 internally exclusively uses the UTF-8 characterset. This means
that if you want to use your old ariadne data with this version, you
need to make sure that your old data will also be imported as UTF-8.

If your old data is not already in the UTF-8 charset, you can use the
import mechanism to convert this. The parameters are:

	--convertToUTF8-[nls]=[charset]

This option tells import to convert all data for the
language [nls] from the charset [charset] (CP1252 is default) to
UTF-8.

Note 1: The conversion routine uses the iconv character conversion routines,
which are part of the normal C library. Depending on which C library you
use, you may or may not be able to convert from the source character set to
UTF-8.

Note 2: CP1252 is the name of the character set that windows uses instead
of ISO-LATIN-1 (ISO-8859-1) in most western countries. It is the normal 
latin-1 character set extended with a few extra characters.
