The Ariadne FTP loader.
----------------------------------

1. What does it do?
-------------------

The Ariadne FTP loader is a PHP script which can handle FTP requests
and translate them to Ariadne specific requests. This way you can use 
an FTP client for:

	- adding and editing templates
	- adding and editing files / photos
	- object renaming
	- object (and tree) deletion
	- creating directories

2. Configuring the Ariadne FTP loader.
--------------------------------------

The Ariadne FTP loader configuration files are found in the
ariadne/lib/configs/ftp/ directory. In there you can find a standard
configuration file (default.phtml-dist) which you can use to setup
the Ariadne FTP loader. In this section we will walk through all available
configuration settings.

	$ftp_config['server_ip']

	This variable tells the FTP loader to use this ip number for 'passive' 
	modes. When a client starts a passive mode transaction, the server 
	tells the client which ip adress to connect to.

	$ftp_config['root']

	This variable sets the root of the FTP site. Default value is '/'.

	$ftp_config['greeting']

	The content of this variable will be printed when a client connects to the
	Ariadne FTP server.

	$ftp_config['debugfile']

	If you turn on the debug system within the Ariadne loader, all messages
	will be written to this file. Make sure that the Ariadne FTP server
	user (see 4.2,4.3) has write permissions on this file.


3. Setting up Ariadne
---------------------

3.1 User grants
---------------

If you want to give a user ftp access to Ariadne, you need to set the 'ftp'
grant for that user on the path specified in $ftp_config['root'].
Note that the 'admin' user will always have access.

3.2 File-type casting
---------------------

The Ariadne FTP server has the ability to cast/transform certain file types 
(based on their mimetype) to Ariadne object types. The default object type
for uploaded files is 'pfile'. With the file-type cast feature you can, for
example, tell the FTP server that it has to create a pphoto when the mimetype 
of the uploaded file matches 'image/.*'. These filetype casts can
be configured in the ariadne/lib/configs/ariadne.phtml configuration file.

An example of such an configuration entry is:

	$ARConfig->cache[".."]->mimetypes['^image/']= "pphoto";
	$ARConfig->cache[".."]->mimetypes['.*']		= "pfile";

	the ->mimetype's index is the regular expression tested against
	the mimetype of the uploaded file. The value is the object type
	which the file has to be casted to.


4. How to install the Ariadne FTP loader as an FTP server.
----------------------------------------------------------

4.1 Prerequisites
-----------------

In order to install the Ariadne FTP loader as an FTP server you need the 
following system configuration:

	- an inetd/xinetd (or equivalent) application.
	(windows users can find a inetd program in ariadne/bin/inetd.exe)

	- a php-cgi binary, version 4.0.6 or higher, with mysql (or postgresql) 
	  and socket support.	

Then you have to decide which port you want to use for the Ariadne FTP
server. The standard port for FTP is 21, but since Ariadne can't share
that port with an existing FTP server, we recommend to choose another
port for it. In the following examples we will bind the Ariadne FTP server to
port 2121.


4.2 Installing under inetd.
---------------------------

To register the Ariadne FTP server with inetd, edit the file
/etc/inetd.conf. Add an entry similar to the following to the inetd.conf file:

2121 stream tcp nowait www-data /usr/bin/php \
     -f /usr/local/lib/ariadne/ftp/loader.php default.phtml

Explanation:

[port] stream tcp nowait [webserver user] [path to php] \
     -f [ftp loader] [config file]

	- for [port] you should fill in the port number to use (e.g. 2121)

	- [webserver user] this is the user that your webserver is running as.
	Typically this is 'www-data' for Debian based systems and 'apache' for 
	redhat based systems.

	- [path to php] is the location of your php-cgi binary. This is typically 
	/usr/bin/php

	- [ftp loader] this is the path to the Ariadne FTP loader. If you have 
	installed Ariadne under /usr/local/lib/ariadne/, the path to the Ariadne 
	FTP loader will be /usr/local/lib/ariadne/ftp/loader.php

	- [config file] The filename of the configuration file. The default
	filename is "default.phtml".


After you have added the entry to the inetd.conf, you should reload it. On 
Debian based systems you need to execute the following line:

	/etc/init.d/inetd reload

On RedHat based systems:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/inetd reload


4.3 Installing under xinetd.
----------------------------

To register the Ariadne FTP server with xinetd you have to add a configuration
file under /etc/xinet.d/ for the Ariadne FTP service, we will name it ariadne_ftp.

This file should contain something like:

	service	unlisted {
		port		= 2121
		type		= UNLISTED
		protocol	= tcp
		disable		= no
		flags		= REUSE
		socket_type 	= stream
		user		= apache
		server		= /usr/bin/php
		server_args	= -f /usr/local/lib/ariadne/ftp/loader.php default.phtml
	}


Explanation:

	- 'port' this line contains the port number you want the
	Ariadne FTP server to listen on. 

	- The 'user' field contains the user that your webserver is running as.
	Typically this is 'www-data' for Debian based systems and 'apache' for 
	RedHat.

	- The 'server' variable contains the path to the php-cgi binary

	- 'server_args' contains the path to the ftp loader
	(/usr/local/lib/ariadne/ftp/loader.php) and the configuration file of the
	loader (default.phtml)

In order to activate these changes, you need to reload the xinetd configuration
files by executing:

	On RedHat based systems:

	/etc/rc.d/init.d/xinetd reload

4.4 Installing under windows
----------------------------

To install the ariadne ftp server under windows you have to edit
the ftpd.bat file found in the ariadne/bin/ directory. Change here
the path to your php cgi and the path to the ariadne ftp loader.

When done with configering you can double click the ftpd.bat file
in order to run the ariadne ftp server. 

5. Problems
----------------------------

If after following the instructions for installation your Ariadne FTP Server
doesn't work. Telnet to the port specified in your configs. The server
should return an errormessage. This can be something like:

------ telnet 0 2121 -------
Trying 0.0.0.0...
Connected to 0.
Escape character is '^]'.
X-Powered-By: PHP/4.1.0
Content-type: text/html

<br>
<b>Fatal error</b>:  Failed opening required
'/usr/local/lib/ariadne/lib/configs/ftp/default.phtml'
(include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php') in
<b>/usr/local/lib/ariadne/ftp/loader.php</b> on line <b>10</b><br>
Connection closed by foreign host.
----------------------------

In this case the default.phtml is missing, since I forgot to change it from
default.phtml-dist to default.phtml :^)
