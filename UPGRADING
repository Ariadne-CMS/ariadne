Upgrading to 2.0b10/2.0b11                                         Muze Ariadne
================================================================================

Ariadne 2.0b10 introduces a lot of low level changes, not only in the
database store, but also in the export file format. For this reason,
upgrading is a bit more complex.

0.	Backup your Ariadne code and database. But you do that regulary
	anyway, right? :)

1.	Before you upgrade the Ariadne code, export your current site. 
	You can run export as root, or as the web user (e.g. www-data),
	from the ariadne/bin/ directory, e.g.:

	./export / oldsite.ax
	

2.	Install Ariadne 2.0b10 as if it was a fresh Ariadne installation.
	Please see the file INSTALL for more information.
	Make sure that you do not use the same database as for the previous
	version of Ariadne. You can also simply drop the old databases and
	remove the old code...

3.	In ariadne.2.0b10/bin/ run:

	./axconvert [ax_file] > [new_ax_file]

	e.g.

	./axconvert oldsite.ax > newsite.ax

	This converts your old data to the new file format.

4.	Now make sure you are logged in as the web user (e.g. www-data) or
	root and run:

	import [new_ax_file] [path]

	e.g.

	import newsite.ax /

	If ran it as root, make sure the files (ariadne/files/) are chowned to
	the web user.
