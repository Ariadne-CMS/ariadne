  -> problem with new object, while you're creating a new object, it doesn't
     exist yet, so saving via a call to a url won't work, you can only save in
     the form. Create a special check for this?
     -> remove from form, after save new object ask if the user wants to
        enter the html for the object

- onClose: check isDirty -> ask to save first
- menu: file -> close
- in source view: generate a <br> on return
		  disable format and html menu options.
- context menu: background color (body, table, cell)
                title ?
- differentiate between page and file object editing: file -> full html,
  page -> only body.innerHTML.
