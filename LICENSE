==============================================================================

Ariadne is distributed under the Gnu General Public License, see the
LICENSE.GPL file for the full text.

In addition to the terms and conditions defined in the GPL, Muze grants you
the right to write new classes, templates, modules, widgets and installation
scripts, which are extensions on existing Ariadne files and distribute these
under any license you choose, as long as these files are distributed
seperately from Ariadne itself.

What this means is that you are allowed to create your own applications which
need Ariadne to run and sell these under a commercial (closed source) license,
as long as this application doesn't change existing classes or templates, and
doesn't extend the Ariadne store or loader. You must distribute this
application as a seperate package or file. You may include Ariadne on the same
distribution media, as long as you keep the Ariadne open source distribution 
intact, including all files and license information.
