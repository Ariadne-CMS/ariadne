Reusing Browser Technology - DHTML Editing Control
===================================================
Last Updated: Sep.19,1999


SUMMARY
========
The DHTML Editing control provides a full-featured WYSIWYG HTML editor 
as a control that you can add to any application. This particular sample 
shows the DHTML Editing control hosted in a document called fulledit.htm - 
in other words, it shows a Web page that allows you to edit other Web pages.


DETAILS
========
When you run the sample, most of the document's client area is taken up 
by the DHTML Editing control, where you can enter and edit text. You can 
apply most the control's editing commands using the toolbar, a context 
menu, and dialog boxes (all implemented in DHTML). The sample shows you 
how you can activate and inactivate toolbar buttons depending on the 
current state of the selection or document. To create a new HTML document, 
just start typing. Save your document with commands from the File menu. 
Or enter the URL for any document on any Web site into the URL box, and 
when the document appears, you can edit away.


USAGE
======
The control illustrated by this sample is not marked as safe for scripting. 
You might need to adjust your browser's security settings to allow you to 
run this sample.


OTHER
======
This sample is one of several that illustrate how you can use the DHTML 
Editing Component to create WYSIWYG HTML editing in applications. Additional 
samples show: 

- Alternative ways to use the control in Web pages. 

- Using the control in Visual Basic forms. 

- Using the DHTML Editing Component Doc Object from a C++ application.
 
 
BROWSER/PLATFORM COMPATIBILITY
===============================
This sample requires Internet Explorer 5 on the Win32 platform. The editing 
control is installed as part of Internet Explorer 5. When you run the sample, 
you'll be asked whether it's ok to run "Some software (ActiveX controls)." 
Choose Yes.
