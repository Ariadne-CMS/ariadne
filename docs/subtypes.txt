Subtypes support
----------------

Since Ariadne 2.4 HEAD, Ariadne has support to create new class names which
extend default Ariadne classes. An example of such a classname name could be 
ppage.email. This classname can then be used to register templates for, and
behave different than the normal default class (in this case 'ppage').


Registering subtypes
--------------------

To be able to use subtypes, you have to register them in the 
/system/ariadne/types/ and the /system/ariadne/typetree/ directories (like
you would do with normal php classes). An example: For registering the new
subtype 'ppage.email', we would create an object (pobject) named 'email'
under /system/ariadne/types/. The value of this object should be
'ppage.email'. Now we also want this object to be addable under directories,
which we do by linking the new created object under 
/system/ariadne/typetree/normal/pdir/.


Using subtypes
--------------

After having registered the subtype, we are now able to select this type 
from the object->new menu and create an object of that type. 

Creating templates for this subtype is as easy as adding a new template
and selecting the subtype from the 'types' list in the pinp editor.


Status
------

Subtype support is still in development and behaviour of it can change through
time. 

Known problems: 
	- class icons are broken
	- you can't find subtypes by querying them with "implements = 'type.subtype'",
	use "type = 'type.subtype'" instead.
