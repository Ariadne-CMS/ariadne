SVN Server                                                      Muze Ariadne 2.0
================================================================================

You can download the latest development version of Ariadne from
our CVS server using a public read-only svn account.

Our SVN server can be contacted via host 'svn.muze.nl', 

If you use the default cvs system for linux, you can access it using:
	
	svn co https://svn.muze.nl/svn/ariadne/trunk ariadne

If you later want to get a newer version of the code do:

	svn update ariadne

in the same directory you initially did the checkout.

If you have any questions you can contact us at info@muze.nl, but read the 
newsgroups at news.muze.nl first.

happy hacking,
