CVS Server													  Muze Ariadne 2.0b7
================================================================================

From now on you can download the latest development version of Ariadne from
our CVS server using a public read-only cvs account. We will still release
'stable' snapshots from time to time, hopefully not too many untill the first
non-beta release :)

Our CVS server can be contacted via host 'ariadne.muze.nl', with login 'guest' 
and password 'guest'. It runs on the default port '2401'.

If you use the default cvs system for linux, you can access it using:

	export CVSROOT=:pserver:guest@ariadne.muze.nl:/var/cvs
	cvs login
	cvs checkout ariadne

If you later want to get a newer version of the code do:

	cvs update -d ariadne

in the same directory you initially did the checkout.

If you have any questions you can contact us at info@muze.nl, or you can try
to read the newsgroups at ariadne.muze.nl first.

happy hacking,
Auke van Slooten
