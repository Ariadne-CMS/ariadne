   Returns the complete PHP object. This should only be used for 
   complex operations where the normal method of only returning the 
   data needed is insufficient.
   
   NOTE: This template should be included in every template directory
   since it is often used with a large find or ls query. Failing to
   so will result in a large performance penalty.
