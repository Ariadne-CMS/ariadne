KNOWN ISSUES

- Accessing Ariadne, containing a valid sessionid from another host, will not load
  a user. This will lead to a Fatal Error (Fatal error: Call to undefined
  function: findgrants() in ...) when a custom login template has been made
  that call()s subsequent templates. Workaround: do not call templates within
  your custom login template.
