/**
 *	This component implements an event system very similar to events in modern browsers. Events have
 *	a seperate capture and listen phase. Events are fired and listened to on a 'path' - like a
 *	filesystem path - instead of an object in the DOM. In the capture phase listeners are called in
 *	order starting with listeners on the root path '/'. Then - if the event has not been cancelled -
 *	in the listen phase listeners are called in the reverse order - with the root path being called
 *	last.
 *	If the context stack is available you can change the default path events are fired on and listened
 *	to by changing the 'path' entry in the context stack.
 *
