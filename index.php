If you are reading this, it probably means that you have unpacked all of
Ariadne into the webroot. For security reasons, Ariadne should be installed
outside of the webroot instead. The 'www' directory is the only part of
Ariadne that should be installed in the webroot. You can name this directory
to something more appropriate, for instance 'ariadne'.
